# âœ… Requirement Fulfillment for Front-End Development (35%) : 
#  I. Use React to create the applicationâ€™s front-end :
The front-end of the application is built entirely using React, enabling efficient and reusable UI components (eg, `src/App.jsx`)
---

#  II. Use CSS to style the application :
The applicationâ€™s styling is done using 2 pages CSS (`src/components.jsx`) for the components files and (`src/pages.jsx`) for the pages files, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design
---

#  III. Create at least four different views or pages for the application :
The application includes multiple views such as (`Login.jsx`, `Statistics.jsx` and `HRDashboard`), 
---

#  IV. Create some form of navigation that is included across the applicationâ€™s pages, utilizing React Router for page rendering :
The application uses React Router to navigate between pages seamlessly like in the (`Header.jsx`) and (`HeaderHr.jsx`) files
---
# V. Use React Hooks or Redux for application state management : 
The application uses multiples React Hooks 

### Example
```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
```
---
# VI. Interface directly with the server and API that you created :
The application interacts with the backend API to manage data dynamically using Axios in the 2 files (`services/apiUsers.jsx` and `services/apiAirports.jsx`)

### Example
```javascript
import axios from 'axios'
// Login service
export const login = async (email, password) => {
    const response = await axios.post(`${URL}/auth/login`, { email, password });
    return response.data; };
```
